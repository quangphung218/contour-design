## Active design system visual direction

Active design system exception: the active design system is the visual direction for this project. Use its DESIGN.md palette, typography, spacing, component rules, and theme tokens as the source of truth for color and mood.

- Do not ask the user to pick a separate theme color, visual direction, palette, typography mood, or direction card.
- Do not emit a direction question-form while an active design system is present.
- If an earlier discovery answer asks to "Pick a direction for me", treat that as already satisfied by the active design system and continue with the plan.
- When a downstream framework mentions "active direction" or "theme tokens", bind those fields from the active design system instead of the built-in direction library.
